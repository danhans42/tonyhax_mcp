# Memcard Pro/SD2PSX Support

This version has basic support added for the MemcardPro/SD2PSX Memory Card Devices to send GameID.
It detects and supports a card in the first slot ONLY. No page change support or otherwise.

It may also be compatible with ps1digital, not sure if PicoMemCard supports GameID?


# Information
It utilises the MemCardPro_ASM library from Cybdyn.
